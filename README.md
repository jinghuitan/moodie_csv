- an experiment with nlp to geenrate mood playlist using existing spotify csv.
findings:
- csv is nice, but not practical. there are new songs release every single day, meaning csv might be outdated.
- streamlit is a really useful open source, but it has limitation when it comes to styling the front end
- generally the website work pretty well, but it can be further enhanced such as adding spotipy library (instead of using local csv file,
  access spotify library instead and allow user to save playlist to their own spotify account)
